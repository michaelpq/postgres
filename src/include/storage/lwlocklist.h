 * defined by the caller for special purposes.
 *
 * Also, generate-lwlocknames.pl processes this file to create lwlocknames.h.

/*
 * Some commonly-used locks have predefined positions within MainLWLockArray;
 * these are defined here.  If you add a lock, add it to the end to avoid
 * renumbering the existing locks; if you remove a lock, consider leaving a gap
 * in the numbering sequence for the benefit of DTrace and other external
 * debugging scripts.  Also, do not forget to update the section
 * WaitEventLWLock of src/backend/utils/activity/wait_event_names.txt.
 *
 * Note that the names here don't include the Lock suffix, to appease the
 * C preprocessor; it's added elsewhere.
